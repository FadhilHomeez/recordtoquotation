Hi boss, coming to see my 4-room flat right?
Basically the living room wall there, the divider one, I want to do Wall Hacking.
Then before you start work, confirm must do 1 round of floor protection coverage right?
For the toilet and kitchen, can help me Dismantle toilet accessories?
The ceiling cornices throughout unit also need removal.
Painting wise, we looking at the standard Up To 2 Coats Of Paint packages.
And lastly, clearing of debris is included right? 
Oh, and I also want Custom Marble Countertop for the kitchen island.
Can give me a quote?
