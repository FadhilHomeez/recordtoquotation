Opening & Pleasantries (0:00 - 1:00)

[00:00:00] ID (Alex):
Hi Mr. and Mrs. Tan, thanks for coming down. I'm Alex. Did you find the place alright?

[00:00:15] Client (Mr. Tan):
Yes, we did, thanks. The map was clear. Your office is lovely.

[00:00:25] ID (Alex):
Glad to hear it! Can I get you both a coffee or tea?

[00:00:30] Client (Mrs. Tan):
A water would be great, thank you.




Project Overview (1:00 - 3:00)

[00:01:10] ID (Alex):
Alright, so you're looking to renovate your new 5-room BTO in Punggol, correct? Congratulations! That's a great area.

[00:01:30] Client (Mr. Tan):
That's right. We just got our keys. It's completely bare, so we need to do everything from scratch.

[00:02:05] ID (Alex):
Perfect, a blank canvas! Do you have a particular theme in mind? Scandinavian, minimalist, industrial?

[00:02:45] Client (Mrs. Tan):
We're leaning towards a modern luxury feel. Lots of clean lines, maybe some marble accents, but still cozy.




Living Room Discussion (3:00 - 6:00)

[00:03:15] ID (Alex):
I love that. Okay, let's start with the living room. What are your thoughts on flooring?

[00:03:40] Client (Mr. Tan):
We were thinking of large format tiles, something glossy. Maybe 800x800mm?

[00:04:10] ID (Alex):
Good choice. For the TV wall, we could do a feature with a marble-look laminate. And maybe a false ceiling with some cove lighting to set the mood.

[00:04:45] Client (Mrs. Tan):
Ooh, I like the sound of cove lighting. What about the wall behind the sofa? Just paint?

[00:05:20] ID (Alex):
We can do a nice neutral grey paint for most of the walls. We'll use a good quality Nippon paint. For the sofa wall, maybe a subtle wallpaper or fluted panels?




Small Talk Interlude (6:00 - 8:00)

[00:06:00] Client (Mr. Tan):
Fluted panels sound interesting. By the way, I saw the photos of that Duxton project on your website. Really impressive work.

[00:06:30] ID (Alex):
Oh, thank you! That was a fun one. The clients gave us a lot of creative freedom. The view from that apartment was incredible.

[00:07:05] Client (Mrs. Tan):
It looked like it! The weather has been so hot lately, hasn't it? Hard to imagine doing any renovation work.

[00:07:45] ID (Alex):
Tell me about it! My team is drinking so much water on-site. But we manage. Okay, so back to the kitchen.




Kitchen Discussion (8:00 - 10:00)

[00:08:20] ID (Alex):
For the kitchen, you mentioned wanting a functional, sleek look. I'd recommend quartz for the countertop. It's durable and looks great. For the cabinets, we can do laminate finishing.

[00:08:50] Client (Mr. Tan):
Yes, quartz is a must. How much would a top and bottom kitchen cabinet setup cost? Let's say for about 20 feet.

[00:09:30] ID (Alex):
I'll get you a detailed price, but it's roughly around $130 per foot run for the cabinets. We'll also need to do the plumbing for the sink and a backsplash. Glass or tile?

[00:10:05] Client (Mrs. Tan):
I think a tempered glass backsplash would be easier to clean.




Bedroom & Wardrobe Discussion (10:00 - 12:30)

[00:10:40] ID (Alex):
Great. Now for the master bedroom. Wardrobe?

[00:11:10] Client (Mr. Tan):
We need a full-height wardrobe, about 8 feet long. Sliding door to save space.

[00:11:45] ID (Alex):
Noted. And for the flooring in the bedrooms, a lot of clients are opting for vinyl flooring these days. It's warmer than tiles.

[00:12:20] Client (Mrs. Tan):
Yes, let's do vinyl for all three bedrooms. What about the bathrooms?




Bathroom & Hacking Discussion (12:30 - 15:00)

[00:13:00] ID (Alex):
For the two bathrooms, we'll need to overlay the walls and floor with new tiles. We'll also supply and install a new vanity cabinet with a sintered stone top for the master bathroom, and a new shower screen.

[00:13:45] Client (Mr. Tan):
Okay. And what about hacking? We want to hack the kitchen wall to create an open concept space.

[00:14:20] ID (Alex):
Absolutely. We'll handle the hacking of the kitchen wall, and of course, the haulage and debris disposal. We'll also need to make good the floor after hacking.




Closing (15:00 - 15:15)

[00:15:00] ID (Alex):
Okay, I think I have a good understanding of your requirements. I'll work on a preliminary quotation based on our discussion and send it over to you by tomorrow evening. How does that sound?

[00:15:15] Client (Mrs. Tan):
That sounds perfect. We look forward to it.
